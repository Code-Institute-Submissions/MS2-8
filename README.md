# Happy Burpees WOD

My project is a site for CrossFit practitioners.  It contains a page where you can fill in what type of WOD (exercise) you want to do and on wich level. This will show you a WOD suited for you and let you choose an other WOD if you are not happy with the one suggested for you.
Every WOD also have a timer that count down if you have a WOD you should do within a specific timecap or count up if you want to see for how long the WOD takes to submit for you.
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX

- As a CrossFit practitioner you always want to find new WODs to try at home or in the BOX, therefore you will find some good workouts on the site.
- As a CrossFit practitioner you want to adjust the WOD by your gender, therefore you get the option to select if you are a man or a woman.
- As a CrossFit practitioner you want to adjust the WOD by your skills, therefore you get the option to select if your WOD whether should be hard (RX) or easy (scaled).
- As a CrossFit practitioner you want to adjust the WOD by type of WOD, therefore you get the option to select the WOD type (AMRAP, EMOM or RFT).
- As a CrossFit practitioner you want to see the time it takes to go through a WOD, how much time you have to deal with to go through the WOD or how much time that is remaining of the WOD, therefore you see a timer connected to the WOD you have chosen.
- As a CrossFit practitioner I want inspiration and therefore the site have social media links to get you what you want.
- As a CrossFit practitioner you sometimes have questions or suggestions therefore you find Contact information with an e-mail address.
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Timer should have 10 seconds countdown when you have pressed the start button to start the WOD.
- Timer should have some kind of alarm or signal based on how much time that have passed or remaining time of the WOD.
- Timer should give you a signal every minute if you have chosed a EMOM WOD.
- The EMOM WOD should highlight the next exercise every minute.
- If the site had WODs with weights based on your 1RP (1 repetition max) there should be at counter connected to the WOD so the weights was based on your individual weights. For example if you should make 10 repetitions on 50% of your 1RM and your 1RM is 100kg it should show you 50kg and so on.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
