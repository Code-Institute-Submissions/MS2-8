# Happy Burpees WODs

My project is a site for CrossFit practitioners.  It contains a page where you can fill in what type of WOD (exercise) you want to do and on wich level. This will show you a WOD suited for you and let you choose an other WOD if you are not happy with the one suggested for you.
Every WOD also have a timer that count down if you have a WOD you should do within a specific timecap or count up if you want to see for how long the WOD takes to submit for you.

## Features
 
### Existing Features

- Timer count down - If a WOD has a time limit, the timer will display the time in a readable way and start counting down when clicking button.
- Timer count up - If a WOD doesn't have a time limit, the timer will start counting up when clicking button.
- Timer start/stop - When clicking button the timer starts to count (up or down based on WOD-type) so practitioner can start workout. If practioner need a break, the same button will paus/stop the timer.
- Timer reset - allows a practitioner to restart timer.
- Filter and get WOD suggestion - let you fill in what type of WOD you would like to filter by.
- Male/Female (weight) toggle - let you fill in wich gender and get the weights for the WOD based on that.

### Features Left to Implement

- Timer should have 10 seconds countdown when you have pressed the start button to start the WOD.
- Timer should have some kind of alarm or signal based on how much time that have passed or remaining time of the WOD.
- Timer should give you a signal every minute if you have chosed a EMOM WOD.
- The EMOM WOD should highlight the next exercise every minute.
- If the site had WODs with weights based on your 1RP (1 repetition max) there should be at counter connected to the WOD so the weights was based on your individual weights. For example if you should make 10 repetitions on 50% of your 1RM and your 1RM is 100kg it should show you 50kg and so on.

Timer functions are tested by using jasmine.

- Test spec files are named as the corresponding js-file, timer.spec.js.
- Test suites are named after functions tested.
- Test functions are using format "given, when, then".
- UI-components are added as hidden elements in /testrunner/index.html which makes it possible to test UI-components values and behaviour.

## Bugs Found

Comment from my mentor was that the timer had some time delay and he was able to click the start button before the time was set. This is probably due to a delay from API call.
To solve this problem I could have added a spinner.
